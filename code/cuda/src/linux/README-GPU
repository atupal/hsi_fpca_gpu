GPU-Accelerated LIBSVM is exploiting the GPU, using the CUDA interface, to
speed-up the training process. This package contains a new executable for 
training classifiers "svm-train-gpu.exe" together with the original one.
The use of the new executable is exactly the same as with the original one.



FEATURES

Mode Supported

    * c-svc classification with RBF kernel

Functionality / User interface

    * Same as LIBSVM


PREREQUISITES

    * NVIDIA Graphics card with CUDA support
    * Latest NVIDIA drivers for GPU
    * CUDA toolkit & GPU Computing SDK 5.5 

    Download all in one package from:    
	https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
	

INSTRUCTIONS

	1. Install the NVIDIA drivers, CUDA toolkit and GPU Computing SDK code samples. You can find them all in one package here: 

	https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads (Version 5.5)

	You may need some additional packets to be installed in order to complete the installation above. 

	A very helpful and descriptive guide is on the CUDA webpage: 

	http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux/index.html

	Make sure you have followed every step that is relevant to your system, like declaring $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH on your bash configuration file.

	2. Copy this folder anywhere you like.

	3. Use the Makefile found inside this folder.

	4. Find the "svm-train-gpu" executable inside this folder.


Troubleshooting

	1. Nearly all problems are resolved by reading carefully through the nvidia guidelines.

	2. When making, there is a chance a "cannot find cublas_v2.h" or "cuda_runtime.h" error to arise. Find where these files are located (Default path is: "/usr/local/cuda-5.5/include") and replace the paths on the header files in "kernel_matrix_calculation.c" file with your system paths. Also you can change the location of the default CUDA toolkit path on the makefile (CUDA_PATH ?= "/usr/local/cuda-5.5") to your cuda toolkit path.
