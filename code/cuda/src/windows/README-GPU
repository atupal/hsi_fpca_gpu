GPU-Accelerated LIBSVM is exploiting the GPU, using the CUDA interface, to
speed-up the training process. This package contains a new executable for 
training classifiers "svm-train-gpu.exe" together with the original one.
The use of the new executable is exactly the same as with the original one.

This executable was built with the CUBLAS API version 2 which is compatible with SDKs from 4.0 and up.
